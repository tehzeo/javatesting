>  2.Type 'javac MyFirstJavaProgram.java' and press enter to compile your code. If there are no errors in your code, the command prompt will take you to the next line      (Assumption: The path variable is set).
>  3.Now, type ' java MyFirstJavaProgram ' to run your program.
>  4.You will be able to see the result printed on the window.
